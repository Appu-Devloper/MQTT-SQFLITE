MQTT and Sqflite
This Flutter project demonstrates how to integrate MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) communication and Sqflite database in a Flutter application. The application allows users to connect to an MQTT broker, publish and subscribe to topics, and store connection information in a local Sqflite database. Additionally, error handling for MQTT connection and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Sqflite are implemented.

Features
MQTT Integration: Connect to an MQTT broker, publish and subscribe to topics.
Error Handling: Display error messages if there are any issues with MQTT connection.
Sqflite Database: Store connection information locally using Sqflite database.
CRUD Operations: Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Sqflite database.
